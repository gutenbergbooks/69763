<p>“It did,” said Kwasa.</p>

<p>“It didn’t,” said Wiki.</p>

<p>“But I say there were three reds up,” insisted Kwasa.</p>

<p>“And I say one of the dice came up white,” argued
Wiki.</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Kwasa good-humoredly, “we will
not quarrel about a game. I will throw again.”</p>

<p>Catching up the three small sticks of cane, painted red
on the hollowed inner side and white on the upper part,
Kwasa tossed them deftly into the air. They came down
all together, landing on the stone pavement with the
white sides up.</p>

<p>Kwasa gave a cluck of triumph.</p>

<p>“Three whites; better yet.” Reaching across the
stone slab covered with a pattern of circles and lines
which served as a game board, he carefully moved a
white pebble from the mark where it stood to one two
spaces nearer the center of the slab.</p>

<p>Wiki seized the dice eagerly. “Well done! Now it
is my turn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>Into the air spun the three sticks again, but as they
came down Wiki saw with disappointment that one
showed the white side while the other two had fallen
with the red uppermost.</p>

<p>“No play,” cried Kwasa.</p>

<p>“But I have one more throw,” said Wiki, and this time
three reds gleamed against the gray rock floor.</p>

<p>“One space, anyway,” said Wiki, and this time a red
pebble on the farther side of the slab was set one space
nearer the center.</p>

<p>Kwasa laughed.</p>

<p>“When I have beaten you I will show you how to hold
the dice,” he boasted playfully. “Old Honau showed
me the trick. He can bring down the white every time.”</p>

<p>“I am thirsty,” said Wiki, laying down the dice and
jumping up.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Kwasa, “but it is too far down to the
spring. Let us go to the reservoir.”</p>

<p>The lads ran lightly across the long, narrow court and
climbed a niche staircase hewn in the rock wall at the
back of the cliff. A dozen steps brought them to the top
of the wall, from which they looked down into a huge hollow
in the rock, which appeared to be partly natural and
partly the result of human labor. It was nearly full of
water, which fed slowly into it from a small stream trickling
down from the higher side of the bluff.</p>

<p>On top of the wall stood a graceful olla, or vase-shaped
jar of pottery, strikingly ornamented with red and black.
About the neck was a short, twisted rope of yucca fiber,
long enough to let the jar down to the water. The boys<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
dropped it down and brought it up full, holding it carefully
that it might not strike the side of the wall.</p>

<p>“Bah,” said Wiki, tasting it, “it is too warm to drink,
now that the sun is on it. I would rather have gone to
the spring.”</p>

<p>“Come, then,” cried Kwasa, jumping down from the
wall. “If we go to the spring perhaps we may see something
of the hunters. It is time they were returning, my
grandmother says.”</p>

<p>Kwasa told the truth when he said it was a long way
to the spring. For the great rock-built house, or rather
cluster of houses, in whose inner court the boys had been
playing, was placed three hundred feet from the bottom
of a canyon in a huge cavern which Nature had left in
the face of the precipitous cliff. Along the outer edge
of the cavern, following the outline of the opening, was
a high wall of masonry pierced with numerous openings
that served as doors and windows. So exactly had the
builders matched the color of the rocky cliff face, and so
skilfully was the great structure placed in its lofty niche,
that a traveler in the canyon below could hardly have
told it was there at all.</p>

<p>This outer wall was in some places four stories high.
Back of it the building was terraced down to the floor of
the cave, each story projecting beyond the one above it
so that its roof made a sort of porch for the upper rooms.
Rude ladders were everywhere, leading from each story
to the next, for the people who lived in this peculiar
dwelling liked to go up and down from the outside. Each
story was divided into many rooms, most of them rather<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
small, but several near the center of the structure being
of good size. In some of these were stone fireplaces for
cooking, and one, larger than any of the others, was set
apart for ceremonial use.</p>

<p>Back of the great house, or rather village, for it was
the home of many families, was a long and narrow court
running well back under the sheltering slope of the cavern
roof. Here the children could play and the women
could weave and grind and make pottery and mats in
well-guarded safety, for back of them and overhead rose
the mighty arch of the cavern, and between them and the
cliff’s edge stood the solid sandstone structure.</p>

<p>Where the cave roof slanted down to meet the floor
there were other rooms, built close in under the rock.
These were storerooms where food was kept. In them
were great piles of beans and corn, rolls of piki or paper
bread which the women were forever baking over the
fireplaces, and immense quantities of buffalo meat, dried
and pounded fine and laid away between layers of tallow.
In one of these rooms was kept the colored corn and
beans used in the sacred rites which were held at certain
times in the ceremonial hall, or in the queer, underground
chamber in the center of the court.</p>

<p>Above the cavern the cliff rose sheer and unbroken for
hundreds of feet, but below it the rocky wall fell more
unevenly to the valley far below. The vivid brown and
yellow and red of the upper expanse was varied only here
and there by clumps of cedar or pinon or scrub oak, with
scattering bunches of yucca and cactus between, but on
the lower slope the vegetation was somewhat more dense.<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
All had the same reddish-brown tinge, for it had been a
long time since the rains of the last spring had washed
away the wind-blown dust which whirled down in clouds
from the bare and forbidding surfaces above.</p>

<p>Across the canyon rose another bluff, but this was
unbroken from top to bottom by ledge or cavern. To the
southwest the canyon swept away majestically, broadening
in the distance to a stretch of comparatively level
land through which, in the rainy season, a small river
ran. At the head of the canyon, some distance to the
northeast, was a large spring of sweet, cold water, which,
supplemented by the reservoir at the back of the cavern,
furnished an ample supply for the village.</p>

<p>Down the steep stairway leading from the village to
the valley Kwasa and Wiki went quickly. A stranger
would have had a hard time finding the half-hidden niches
cut in the face of the cliff, but the boys, sure-footed as
mountain goats, were soon in the valley, running eagerly
toward the spring.</p>

<p>“Hush,” warned Kwasa, suddenly crouching behind a
tuft of brown yucca.</p>

<p>Looking where he pointed, Wiki saw the slender figure
of a young man bending over the spring. He drank eagerly,
then taking his cupped hands, poured the cool
water over his dusty limbs as if seeking relief in its freshness.
His face, the boys saw as he turned it toward
them, was weary and seared with the hot, reddish-brown
dust, but young and pleasant, and he did not appear to
be much older than themselves.</p>

<p>“He is none of our people,” whispered Wiki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>“No, but I like him,” exclaimed the impulsive Kwasa.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Wiki sharply. “He may
be a spy of the Utes for all we know.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Kwasa, “for if he were—”</p>

<p>“Here are the hunters,” cried Wiki joyfully, forgetting
all caution and jumping up as a band of men turned
into the canyon from the lower side.</p>

<p>“They are well laden,” observed Kwasa. “The men
of the Snakes never hunt in vain.”</p>

<p>The young man at the spring, hearing their voices,
suddenly straightened himself and looked eagerly about.
Seeing the boys running toward the hunting band, he followed
slowly, his hand resting cautiously upon his spear
shaft, but his frank, brown face expressing nothing but
friendliness.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II
<br><span class="cheaderfont">The Warning</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The long line of hunters, laden with the game secured
by a week’s vigorous chase, was at the niche stairway
before the boys reached them. Impatient to be in the
court when they should arrive, to partake in the welcoming
ceremony, the boys could not wait until the last of
the procession had filed up the dizzy rock steps. Long
before, in their explorations about the canyon, they had
discovered another way to reach the cavern, steeper and
more perilous, but entirely passable for boys whose lives
had been spent in scaling cliffs and finding footholds in
all sorts of precarious places.</p>

<p>Running around a projecting spur and diving through
a thicket of scrub oaks, Kwasa and Wiki were at the
second stairway in a moment. <a id="BRef_007" href="#Ref_007">It was one that few boys
of to-day would care to attempt</a>. It ran almost straight
up the side of the cliff, and in many places they had to
pull themselves from ledge to ledge by straggling tufts of
wiry grass or by the tough, well-rooted clumps of grease-wood
brush. At one spot, to bridge a particularly smooth
and difficult part of the ascent, a pole with sticks bound
upon it at intervals to make a sort of rude ladder had
been swung down from a rocky ledge above.</p>

<p>Up this dangerous ascent Kwasa led the way nimbly,
Wiki following close behind him. The young stranger,<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
after looking doubtfully for a moment from the hunting
band to the boys, finally plunged through the thicket and
took the steeper path, reaching the top only a moment
after Kwasa and Wiki had landed with a final active spring
upon the safe ledge at the rim of the cavern.</p>

<p>“I must speak to your chief quickly,” he said gravely,
as Kwasa, who in the excitement had forgotten all about
the stranger at the spring, looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“But,” began Kwasa, “this is no time—”</p>

<p>“All times are alike when danger threatens,” said the
youth impatiently. “Tell me with whom I should speak.”</p>

<p>Kwasa pointed to a little group of men who stood a little
apart from the rest, waiting to greet the hunters as
they came up, one by one, over the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>“Mosu is a priest,” he said, indicating a tall old man
with a band of flat red and black beads bound about his
forehead. “Honau is very wise, too, and then there is
Bimba—”</p>

<p>But the young stranger had hurried away and was accosting
Mosu, the tall priest, respectfully. Before he had
spoken many words the whole group was listening intently,
and in a few minutes the court was hushed and
all came crowding about to see what this unusual interruption
might mean.</p>

<p>Presently the lad stopped speaking and Mosu held up
his hand for attention.</p>

<p>“This young man is Sado. He comes from the Seven
Cities to bring us tidings to which it were well to listen,
for the Utes are again on the warpath, and the Buffalo
and Fox clans have sent out runners to warn all to the<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
southward. They reached Walpi yesterday, and from
there this messenger brings us word, that we, too, may
be in readiness for an attack.”</p>

<p>“But surely we are safe—”</p>

<p>“They can not reach our village—”</p>

<p>“We could hold the cliff against a thousand, even—”</p>

<p>A babel of voices broke out anxiously. Mosu held up
his hand again.</p>

<p>“All you say is true,” he said. “When our fathers
came here from the Great Mesa, driven out by the savages
from the far north, they sought a place where they
might rest secure from attack. And here they found it.”
He waved his hand toward the great walls of rock rising
protectingly all about them.</p>

<p>“But we must eat, and planting time is near. Those
who stay in the village are indeed secure, but what of the
men who must plant the seeds and care for the grain in
the far fields? We must say farewell to Waka (the sun)
with full storehouses, and with heaped fuel for the cold
days of winter. And if the thieving Utes swarm down
upon our fields and carry off our corn and beans and
squashes, what then? Then there is the danger while
we plant and harvest. The Watcher in the High Tower
must indeed be keen of eye to guard every path that leads
to the fields. It is of these things we must think. And
in the meantime,” he broke off abruptly, “this lad is
weary and hungry. See that he has refreshment and
rest. We must not send him back to the Seven Cities to
tell of our ingratitude for a friendly deed.”</p>

<p>But Sado shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>“There are many others to warn,” he said earnestly.
“I must not stay, though the thought of rest is tempting.
But first I will eat—”</p>

<p>“Has the Snake Clan no runners?” interrupted Mosu
proudly.</p>

<p>Old Honau stepped out from the group.</p>

<p>“I am not fleet of foot as when I was young,” he began,
“but rather than suffer this brave lad to go farther
without rest, I myself will take the warning to the farthest
clan.”</p>

<p>But a dozen lads were already pressing forward, Kwasa
and Wiki among them. Motioning Honau kindly aside,
four of the tallest and strongest were quickly chosen, and
Mosu, drawing them to one side, had Sado repeat carefully
the message he had brought.</p>

<p>“The Rainbow people are yonder,” he said, pointing
southwestward down the open canyon. “And the Bear
Clan is not far from them. It is a three days’ journey—”</p>

<p>“They must take plenty of meat and piki,” called one
of the women, hurrying forward. “We will fill the food-bags
well. It is a long way, but, praise to Waka, the new
springs are filling and they cannot suffer from thirst.”</p>

<p>Immediately there was a great bustle in the court.
Women ran here and there, bringing new sandals of
tough fiber for the feet of the messengers, and thick
woolen blankets for the cool nights in the canyons. The
skin food-bags were quickly filled and strapped over the
slender young shoulders, and Kwasa, as leader, was given
a heavy new spear in addition to the bows and arrows
which they all carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>At last all was ready, and the lads stood forth to be
sprinkled with the sacred meal from the handsome red
and black bowl in Mosu’s hands.</p>

<p>“The Old Ones be with you,” muttered the priest, as
he strewed the meal in a circle about them, and upon the
boys’ bowed heads.</p>

<p>“Come back quickly,” called many anxious voices as,
one by one, the lads dropped down the niche stairway.
Kwasa, the last one to descend, stooped as he left the court
and picked up the three red and white dice with which
he and Wiki had been playing so short a time before.</p>

<p>“For luck,” he laughed, as he dropped them into the
deerskin pouch that hung at his belt.</p>

<p>“Luck is in the hands of the Old Ones, not in painted
sticks,” muttered Tcua, the old grandmother of Kwasa,
watching the lads with anxious eyes as they filed down
the canyon and out of sight. “May they bring back my
son’s son safely—a good lad—a good lad.”</p>

<p>And then she went down to grind corn for piki, for
waiting in idleness is hard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III
<br><span class="cheaderfont">In the Season of Planting</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“The door of the Sun-House is open!”</p>

<p>From mouth to mouth flew the word, brought at sunrise
from the High Tower far up the cliff where Bimba, the
Watcher, kept anxious count of the days till the planting
season should begin.</p>

<p>As if by magic the court was filled with busy men, women
and children. Waka had come back once more to
bring them plenty. It had not been in vain that every
morning and evening they had thrown sacred meal toward
the rising and the setting Sun, beseeching him to
return quickly from his long journey to the south. And
now the glad news had come that he had at last touched
the peak far away to the east that marked his final favor,
and they might get the seeds ready.</p>

<p>Nor was that their only cause of rejoicing. For Kwasa
and his companions had returned the night before, worn
and weary from their long, swift race to the far-off neighbors
at the southwest, but triumphant and proud. They
brought word that the Rainbow people and their near
kinsmen, the Bear Clan, were ready at a moment’s notice
to join them against the dreaded common foe,
whether Ute or Apache. Moreover, in the nine days<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
since Sado had left them word had come that in a terrible
battle between the Utes and the Pueblo people of the
Seven Cities the foe had been repulsed with great slaughter,
and had fled, broken and disabled, to their northern
mountain fastnesses to nurse their wounds. For the
time the danger of attack was over.</p>

<p>So, though the older men of the village still felt some
anxiety, the planting was at last to be begun under much
more favorable circumstances than they had feared. The
women chatted gayly as they brought out the precious
seeds to be sorted, sharpened new planting sticks, and
baked great sheets of piki to pack in the big food-baskets
that were to go with the planters to the distant fields.
The children tumbled about on the terraces or played
games in the angles of the gray walls, even they noticing
the relief in the air which had been so full of dire rumors.</p>

<p>But Kwasa and Wiki, with their two companions, were
more excited than any of the rest. For their service as
messengers they were to be “adopted,” or consecrated,
into the rank of men, and henceforth would take a dignified
place in the Clan, though they were some years
younger than usual for such an honor. For the first
time they were to witness the invocation of the mysterious
deities of the cloud and the sun, which took place
in the kiva, the sacred underground chamber whose
hatchway opened into the court. Mosu, who as head
priest was the person of supreme authority on such occasions,
had even promised them that they might act as
novices at the annual ceremony of the Blessing of the
Seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>When the boys were not following Mosu about they
lingered in fascinated anticipation about the sloping entrance
to the kiva, through which protruded the long
ends of the ladder leading to the depths below. They
had many times descended through the trap-door on the
surface to the great, dusky chamber of the kiva, but never
had they been allowed to witness any of the sacred rites,
except such as were held in the court and were open to
women and children. And now that they were to be admitted
as men to the significant symbolism of the ancient
service, they felt awed and excited by turns.</p>

<p>Kwasa’s grandmother, old Tcua, had long ago told him
the mystic tradition of the Creation, whose sacred story
was perpetuated by the solemn ceremonies in the dimly
lighted chamber. And now, in awed tones, Kwasa repeated
it to Wiki and the others as they sat huddled in
an angle of the lower terrace near the opening to the kiva.</p>

<p>“There were no people then—there were only animals.
They lived far under the ground in dark caves. But the
Old Ones heard them moaning and crying in the dark.
They heard the fox, and the bear, and the duck, and the
wolf, all crying, crying in the dark. And they were
sorry.”</p>

<p>Old as the tale was, the boys listened with breathless
interest.</p>

<p>“So the Old Ones dropped a seed through sipapuh<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
immediately up sprang a wonderful stalk of corn. It
grew up, and up, and up, until at last its head rose into
the sunlight of the Upper World. Then, one at a time,
the fox, and the wolf, and the duck, and all the other<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
animals and birds, came up the great stalk and stood in
the light of Waka, the Sun. And they were no longer
animals, but men and women. We must never forget
this, or the Old Ones will forget us, and we would once
more be animals, back in the middle of the earth, crying
and moaning for the light.”</p>

<p>“But what of the snakes?” whispered Wiki. “My
father says there are more than a hundred in the kisi.”
He nodded toward a brush-covered shelter near the kiva.</p>

<p>“Hush,” replied Kwasa, looking furtively about.
“They are the prayer-bearers, and carry to the Old Ones
the prayers of the Snake Clan for rain, that the crop may
thrive. But we must not speak of that now; it is not
well to talk too much of the gods so near the place where
they dwell.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> A cavity in the floor of the kiva represented the lower world.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV
<br><span class="cheaderfont">The Rites in the Kiva</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For an hour Kwasa had been sitting stiffly on the stone
ledge that ran around the outer wall of the kiva, trying
to get used to the smothering mask Mosu had put over
his head. This mask was a gorgeously painted affair
representing the head of a duck. Feathers of green and
black were fastened to the crest, and a huge bill of yellow
cane projected from the mouthpiece. In it Kwasa
became for the time a Katcina, or one of the supernatural
beings which mediate between gods and men. As a Katcina
he represented one of the ancestral forms which had
emerged from the Lower World upon the day of Creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>A tunic of cotton cloth reached to his knees. It was
brown, and upon it were painted zigzag white lines representing
lightning. Over one shoulder was a yellow
scarf upon which the same design was repeated, and on
his feet were beautifully beaded moccasins, over which
his grandmother had bent for weeks, that they might be
ready when the time should come for her favorite’s adoption
into the ranks of the men. Around his neck, securely
tied in a little buckskin bag, hung a charm, an
exquisite turquoise, blue as the spring skies and half as
large as a swallow’s egg. Old Tcua had fastened this on
with trembling fingers as Kwasa left her to descend to
the kiva, saying as she did so:</p>

<p>“It is for luck. My father had it from an Antelope
priest far to the south. It is yours from this day.”</p>

<p>But Tcua did not know that Kwasa had another charm
which to his boyish imagination was more potent than
the turquoise. Fastened in a fold of his belt were three
red and white sticks of cane, and as the lad sat waiting
on the ledge in the kiva he said to himself:</p>

<p>“I am glad I kept the dice: they have brought me
much of good.”</p>

<p>He felt something thrust into his hand, and looking at
it as closely as he could through the eye-slits in his mask,
he saw it was a prayer-plume, or a short stick to which
were fastened four feathers, white for the north, red for
the east, yellow for the west and green for the south.
This he knew he was to carry in the solemn ceremonies
to follow, as an invocation to the deities who dwell at
the four quarters of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“Come,” said the masked figure that had brought the
prayer-plume, “the gods wait for us.”</p>

<p>At the word, Kwasa slipped down from his seat and
took his place in a long line of youths and men which
was being formed at one end of the kiva. He saw Wiki,
also carrying a prayer-plume, and wearing a beaver’s
mask. In the weird, flickering light from the fire at one
end of the chamber he could not distinguish many that
he knew, and this, together with the strangeness of the
sacred mysteries in which he was about to play a part,
awed and half frightened him.</p>

<p>As the line formed the participants stamped softly
upon the ground with their moccasined feet, not advancing,
but marking time to a wild and monotonous chant
which was accentuated by the rattling of small gourds
in the hands of the priests and their throaty “hi-yi-yi”
as they moved with cat-like tread about the sipapuh in
the middle of the kiva.</p>

<p>At last the line began to move forward. Mosu took
his place at the head and led it around the outer edge of
the kiva, close to the ledge. Round and round they
marched, each time drawing a little closer to the sipapuh.
At last they formed a compact row about the sacred opening,
and in this way encircled it four times more, each
in passing stamping his foot on the stone slab as a hint
to the listening gods that their attention was asked. At
last, at a sign from Mosu, the line halted.</p>

<p>And now came the supreme moment. The participant
who was to be most highly honored was to be chosen to
hold the sacred bowl above the sipapuh while from the<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
mouth of the great snake effigy which was suspended
from above should drop the Kawa-blessed seeds for planting.
Everyone in the circle fixed his eyes upon Mosu,
each secretly hoping that some deed of his own might be
thought worthy such honored recognition.</p>

<p>Kwasa held his breath with the rest, wondering which
one of all the line should be adjudged the most worthy.
And for a moment the tumultuous beating of his heart
made him faint and dizzy as Mosu, beckoning to him and
speaking his name, put the great red and black bowl in
his hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="Ref_023" style="max-width: 40.625em;">

  <div class="caption"><p  class="center">“<a href="#BRef_023">Trembling till he could hardly stand, Kwasa extended his arms until the
bowl was directly above the opening.</a>”</p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="BRef_023" href="#Ref_023">Trembling till he could hardly stand, Kwasa, at a sign
from the priest, extended his arms until the bowl was
directly above the opening</a> in the slab and under the
swinging head of the hollow effigy above. Then through
the tube came the seeds, first the yellow and white corn,
then the beans, the squash and melons, greenish cotton
seeds and rich-smelling brown grains of wheat. At last,
when the bowl was nearly full, there was poured down
the colored corn for the sacred meal, rounding and covering
the rest.</p>

<p>Then Mosu motioned Kwasa to stand to one side, while
Wiki was called forward and given a similar bowl. Delighted
at his friend’s good fortune, Kwasa hardly heard
the muttered congratulations that greeted him as he
stepped back into the circle. But stealthily fingering his
belt he patted the three red and white canes, telling himself
that his own luck and Wiki’s had been unchangeably entwined
since the day they had tossed the dice in the court.</p>

<p>But he had not time for more than a fleeting thought<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
even for such momentous things, for something else was
happening above the sipapuh. This time the attendant
at the hatchway of the kiva poured through the snake
effigy into the sacred bowl a small stream of water, signifying
that thus would the snake deities of the clouds
bless the planted seeds.</p>

<p>At another sign from Mosu, Wiki stepped back into the
circle, and Kwasa came forward to distribute to each person
a handful of the Kawa-blessed seeds. Then, taking a
short stick tipped with stiff turkey feathers, Mosu sprinkled
the water from Wiki’s bowl to the six cardinal points,
north, east, south, west, the zenith and the nadir.</p>

<p>And the ceremony of the Blessing of Seeds was over.</p>

<p>Kwasa was glad to get out of the stifling air of the
kiva and follow the rest up the ladder into the court
above, where the final great rain-prayer rite was to be
performed. In this he had no part, though he still retained
his mask and personated the pawik (duck) katcina
in the great circle that made the background for the
principal actors.</p>

<p>Into this circle marched the long line of Snake and
Antelope priests, participants in this supreme drama of
the year. Very awe-inspiring they looked, their bodies
rubbed with red paint, their blackened chins rimmed
with a broad line of white and their bare arms glittering
with barbaric ornaments. To a sort of hissing chant
they marched about an improvised sipapuh which had
been located in the broadest part of the court, shaking
their rattles and stamping their feet upon the slab as they
passed. Four times they made the circuit, as in the<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
ceremony in the kiva, then suddenly breaking into groups
of three they rushed to the bush-covered kisi near the
end of the circle. A group stopped for a moment before
this shrine, and in a moment proceeded, the foremost
priest, one of the Snake Clan, carrying in his mouth a
squirming snake. The Antelope priest who followed
him, in an apparent frenzy of excitement, waved a feathered
prayer-stick to and fro to attract the reptile’s attention,
but the snake only coiled the more tightly about the
head and shoulders of the carrier. One after another
each group paused at the kisi and secured one of the
wriggling reptiles.</p>

<p>Round and round they marched, and then, at a sign
from Mosu, an attendant suddenly darted forward and
outlined a circle on the floor with sacred meal. Into
this the snakes were dropped, to be sprinkled with meal
as they fell. A wild scramble ensued, and in a few minutes
the snakes were recaptured by the third priests of
the groups, who darted across the court and down the
niche stairway to replace the reptiles in their native
dens. From there they would carry the prayers for rain
to the deities of the clouds, the lightning and the thunder,
who would thus be brought to bless the crops and
insure abundance for the coming year.</p>

<p>“And now we are done with games,” said Wiki softly,
as he and Kwasa descended the ladder into the kiva to
remove their masks and deposit their prayer-plumes before
the sanded altar at the end of the chamber.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Kwasa soberly, “but I shall keep the
dice. They have brought us good luck.”</p>

</div>


<p>Spring in the canyons! How good the warm, moist
air felt after the rains, and how bright and fresh the
young grass looked along the little river so far below the
cliff village. The rusty red of the pinons and oaks, and
of the dull little cedars, too, had been turned to deep,
rich green, and the yucca tufts which clambered bravely
almost to the top of the gorge were sending up new
lances of vivid color. Life was in the air, and it stirred
even the oldest people of the cliff village to a keen interest
in the year’s greatest event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>There was a great stir in the court. On every terrace,
too, were girls and women at work, tying the sharp new
ironwood planting sticks into bundles and shelling the
sacred colored corn which was to be planted in a specially
prepared corner of the field. Great baskets and
bags were filled with food: piki, and pounded acorns
baked in sheets with meal, and strips of hard, dry meat.
There were cakes of buffalo meat, too, pounded fine, and
bags of dried peaches, and beans for eating as well as
planting. For from now on until the crop was ready for
harvest men must stay in the far-away fields to guard as
well as work.</p>

<p>For the first time Kwasa and Wiki were to go with the
men. They strutted about the plaza importantly, one
minute imitating the stately manners of Honau and the
other men, the next strongly tempted to join in the games
of leap-frog and hunt-the-deer that were being carried on
in the crannies of the great building. Strong as the
temptation was, however, they would not have yielded
to it for the world, lest in the eyes of the other lads they
should lose some of their newly acquired dignity.</p>

<p>The great field lay far away to the south of the village,
beyond where the canyon opened out into the wider
valley. For many years the same ground had been cultivated
by the Clan, and on every side were evidences of
the painstaking and careful work that had made possible
the abundance of grain the Cliff people had enjoyed from
year to year. On a gentle slope beyond the field was a
scattering orchard of peach trees, each carefully placed
in some particularly fertile spot. From a great rock<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
reservoir on the hill above, a ditch ran down to the fields,
separating as it reached the edge into many small passways
for water, which could thus be turned upon the
growing crop should the gods, whose aid had been so
earnestly invoked, neglect to send rain enough. Along
the lower edge of the field ran a long, low clay wall or
ledge, designed to keep the water thus led into the planted
land from wasting by running too far down the slope.</p>

<p>How good the brown earth smelled as the sharp planting
sticks turned up the moist soil to make fine, soft beds
for the precious seeds. Where the soil was heavy and
came up in clods, old Honau, the master of the planting,
showed Kwasa and Wiki how to follow behind the seed
scatterers and smash the lumps with stone mauls tied to
the ends of long sticks. They were instructed, too, how
to clean the winter’s wash of mud out of the waterways,
and how to repair the lower wall where it had washed
away.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp99" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i029.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Cliff men going down to work in the fields. The watch tower is seen in
the background.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A round tower built of sandstone blocks stood on a
jutting point of rock far above the fertile valley. Adjoining
it was a low, oblong room fitted with two small
openings. This was both guard and shelter. From the
tower a watcher kept constant lookout, for the men were
far from home and unprotected by natural walls, as they
were in the cliff village, and a sudden rush of enemies
from any of the many intersecting canyons might result
in a terrible loss of life. The watcher was not Bimba,
however, who could not be spared from the watch tower
above the village, where long usage had made him familiar
with every crack and crevice of the hills and valleys<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
within the sweep of his sharp eyes, until not even a rabbit
could cross an open spot undiscovered. Now that
the men were gone it was more important than ever to
have a trusted and experienced watcher to guard the
women and children. So the guardian in the tower above
the great field was not Bimba, but Haida, who, next after
the veteran himself, had the sharpest eyes in the clan.</p>

<p>No alarm came, however, to mar the joy of the planting
time. Day after day the men worked on, cleaning
away every weed and bush as they went, and seeing that
every one of the treasured seeds had its proper chance
to grow and thrive. For upon the crop must depend the
lives of all the next winter. Though they went on occasional
long hunts, the Cliff men were not, like their
neighbors and enemies, the Utes and Apaches, dependent
upon game for the greater part of their living. Corn was
the main food of the people of the cliffs, and whether
parched to be eaten whole, or ground in three-parted
stone metates to be made into the great thin sheets of
piki, or paper bread, it formed the staff of life for them.
Hence the great importance of every seed-grain, for the
winters in the canyons were long and there were many
mouths to feed.</p>

<p>There were long days of work, and weary nights when
the men lay down in the stone shelter adjoining the
watch tower with aching muscles but hopeful hearts;
but at last every seed was in. The irrigating channels
were straight and clean, and the reservoir, as they had
ascertained, was two-thirds full of water. Even so soon
the favor of the gods seemed sure, for twice since the<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
planting had begun good rains had fallen, leaving the
earth dark and mellow and rich with promise.</p>

<p>There must be one more thing done, however, before
they could return to the village for the short stay possible
between the planting and the working of the crop.
Two days before a messenger had been sent to tell Mosu
that the planting was nearly done, and hardly was the
last row finished when they saw him coming. In his
hands he carried a bowl of sacred meal, and upon his
forehead was the mystic raincloud symbol, colored, like
the feathers in the prayer-plume an attendant carried behind
him, with red, green, yellow, and white pigments.
His tunic of beautifully-dressed deerskin was also decorated
with the symbols of the cloud and the sun, while
the snake-like lightning symbols were painted in white
upon his powerful brown arms. A second attendant bore
a great bundle of prayer-plumes, and a third a bowl of
water and a short, stiff brush of turkey feathers.</p>

<p>Solemnly the planters met Mosu as he came toward
them. Falling into line behind him they marched solemnly
around the field, and back to the center where a
hole had been dug and a stone slab placed over it in imitation
of the sipapuh in the kiva. Here they formed into
a hollow square, each side facing a point of the compass.
The attendant distributed the prayer-plumes, which each
man held high in his left hand as Mosu scattered the
sacred meal to north, east, south and west, the zenith
and the nadir. Then into the bowl of water he dipped
the turkey-feather brush, sprinkling the earth toward
the cardinal points. Marching about the improvised sipapuh<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
each man stamped upon it in passing. Then,
stooping reverently, they laid the prayer-plumes underneath
the slab that covered the excavation, and the ceremony
was over.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Sado is,” said Wiki suddenly, as the
boys passed the spring at the head of the canyon on their
way home.</p>

<p>“I hope we may see him again some time,” returned
Kwasa. “Do you suppose he has danced in the kiva yet?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I wish we had not been ‘adopted,’” said
Wiki almost regretfully, “for I would like to throw the
dice again.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not?” laughed Kwasa. “The men play at
that game, and I have never shown you old Honau’s
trick. Besides, here are the dice. Let us hurry home.”</p>

<p>The summer passed pleasantly in the village of the
Cliff. When the men went to the field to work the women
often accompanied them, helping in the cultivation
of the crop and gathering the wild berries and edible
plants that grew in profusion in the fertile valley. In
baskets swung from their heads by woven and padded
bands they carried the ripened peaches up the steep
stairs, spreading them out along the stone ledges to dry.</p>

<p>There was other work, too, that must be done while
the weather was warm and pleasant. New earthenware
bowls must be made while they could be baked in the
summer sun. Garments of soft, exquisitely wrought
feather-cloth, and of fur strips wound on heavy cords and
woven into fabric, must be made ready for cold weather.
There were new rooms to be built, too, for the rapidly
increasing population of the village made the old quarters
too crowded for winter comfort. So the men brought
great gray and brown rocks from the slopes of the canyon,
carrying them suspended from head bands as the
women carried their baskets. These were carefully
chipped and dressed with the great stone mauls, and set
evenly and squarely into place, held there by layers of
mortar which no one except old Honau knew how to mix.<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
Then the women made a thin, plaster-like cement from
colored earths and spread it on with their hands, smoothing
it down with many careful pats which left the prints
of slender brown fingers in many places on the wet wall.
Sometimes the rooms were brightened by wavy red and
yellow lines running bandwise just below the ceiling;
sometimes they were decorated with sacred symbols such
as might bring a peculiar blessing to the household living
in them. But always, whatever the inside might be,
the outside was cunningly wrought to look like the forbidding
walls of the cliff, gray, and dull yellow and brown,
with here and there mottled patches of subdued red, so
that an enemy might have hard work to spy them out in
passing through the canyon below.</p>

<p>It was nearly harvest time, and the corn was already
ripening. Day after day the watcher in the field tower,
keen-eyed Haida, had reported everything well, until the
last lurking fears of even the old men were almost forgotten.
The storerooms were being repaired and made
ready for the new crop, and the men were working on a
larger granary, or storage cist, some distance below the
level of the cavern, where the heavy baskets of corn
might be emptied without carrying them up the last steep
third of the ascent.</p>

<p>Then, early one morning, a wild-eyed messenger from
the field tower came hurtling up the niche stairs in the
gray light to report evil tidings. A band of savages, of
what race he could not say, had ridden their fleet ponies
down through the canyons that night, carrying off and
trampling down a considerable part of the precious crop.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
And what was worse, they had raided the very tower itself
and had left Haida, whose practised eyes had failed
to see them in the moon-blinded lower trail, silent on his
face with an arrow between his shoulders. The messenger
himself had escaped only by dropping quickly into
the farthest shadow of the adjoining shelter-room and
lying motionless against the darkest wall until the last
sound of the ponies’ drumming feet had died away in
the distance.</p>

<p>Mosu quieted the panic-stricken people who crowded
about him in the early light as well as he could. One
thing was sure, if the people of the Cliff were not to
starve when the cold days came, the rest of the crop must
be saved. Wisely seeing in vigorous action the best
remedy for fear, he hastily organized men and women
into bands for taking care of what was left of the grain,
giving to the women the actual work of gathering that
the men might be left free to protect them.</p>

<p>So, leaving the old men and smaller boys to look after
the village, and with many cautions to Bimba to keep
speedy messengers always ready to carry news of danger,
the harvest bands went silently down the steep stairs and
passed swiftly through the canyons to the great field.
Once there, no time was lost in stripping the ears from
the stalks and piling them into the wide-mouthed baskets
which the women carried on their backs, and in cutting
down the stalks with keen-edged flint knives to be carried
home in bundles on the shoulders of the big boys.
The wheat-heads were hastily snatched from their stems,
to be shelled out by busy fingers in the leisure hours of<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
winter. They worked in nervous haste, casting fearful
glances up and down the canyon at every turn. From
the tower the new watchman who had taken dead Haida’s
place strained his eyes anxiously into vague distances,
intent upon guarding, even to his own death, those lives
so dependent upon his vigilance.</p>

<p>Swiftly as they worked, and quickly as the many trips
to and from the village were made, it was many days before
all the crop was safe and the people could breathe
more easily in their well-guarded cavern home. But the
old air of careless gayety was gone, and in its place was
a constant atmosphere of apprehension. No one knew
when the bold savages, encouraged by their success in
the valley, might not undertake even so difficult a task
as the storming of the cliff fastness. Rumors, too, were
constantly afloat of murderous attacks on smaller outlying
cliff dwellings, and once a small party that had been
down the canyon to look for wild gourds came upon the
body of a Cliffman, apparently from one of those distant
houses, lying stiff with a Ute arrow in his breast.</p>

<p>In a consultation of the old men it was at last decided
that the best thing to be done was to send messengers to
the Rainbow and Bear Clans on the south, which were
probably so far free from attack, and to the Seven Cities
on the North, asking them to be ready to send aid should
the threatened danger fall. Mosu, standing stern and
tall in the middle of the court, told the people of this decision
and asked for messengers.</p>

<p>“The Walpi road is a dangerous one,” he said, “to be
undertaken by no one who is afraid to lose his life. He<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
must go alone, for one is as safe as ten, and we have no
lives to risk without great reason. I would not willingly
send any forth to such chance of death, but if one
will offer himself—”</p>

<p>Before he could finish the sentence fifty men and youths
had stepped forward. Mosu looked at them with proud sadness.</p>

<p>“Your lives are precious to us,” he said, his eyes
kindling, “and there are many among you who cannot be
spared. Let those who have wives and children step
back, for them we cannot lose.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly more than half of those who had come forth
drew back again. There remained only the young men,
straight, supple, earnest-eyed lads who were the very
flower of the village. In their brown faces was no sign
of fear. Mosu scanned them, one by one, his lips set in
a thin line, his eyes tenderly kind.</p>

<p>“It is danger we offer you,” he said slowly, “but it is
also the greatest honor we can give. Choose among
yourselves who shall be sent, for you know your own
worth.”</p>

<p>Kwasa stepped forward eagerly.</p>

<p>“Let us toss the dice,” he begged, “and hang our fortunes
on the first who shall throw the whites.”</p>

<p>Mosu thought a moment. The idea appealed to him in
two ways; for one thing, it removed from anyone the responsibility
of sending a comrade forth to possible death,
and for another he knew the gambling spirit was strong
in every Cliffman’s breast and the decision of the dice
would never be disputed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>“Who has dice?” asked Mosu, turning to the onlookers.</p>

<p>Kwasa undid a fold of his belt and gave the priest the
three sticks of cane he had carried so long.</p>

<p>Mosu handed them to the boy who stood nearest. He
tossed them nervously, amid a breathless silence. As they
came down showing two reds and one white, a woman on
the lower terrace gave a sobbing cry. Turning toward
her, his lip quivering with disappointment, the lad saw his
mother, and bounded across the court to where she sat.</p>

<p>“The gods be praised—they have not taken my son
from me,” she said, throwing her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>“But I would have served them well,” he cried, trying
hard to keep back unmanly tears.</p>

<p>One after another the youths came forward to try their
fortunes with the dice. But no one threw the whites together.
Wiki, trembling with eagerness, found them at
his feet with all the red sides up, and gave place to Kwasa,
who came next.</p>

<p>Carefully placing the sticks in his fingers, and with a
quick glance at old Honau, who stood watching with
much interest, Kwasa spun the dice high in the air. And
when they came down every one knew that the danger
and the honor had fallen to Kwasa by the favor of the
gods. Tcua, his old grandmother, scorning the weakness
that fought its way to her moist eyes, called him
proudly to her side and touched the turquoise at his throat.</p>

<p>“You will come back safe—it is a charm,” she said
confidently.</p>

<p>But once more Kwasa hid the cane strips carefully in
his belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I will come back safe—for I have a charm,” he
said, smiling.</p>

<p>So Kwasa took the long trail toward the Seven Cities
alone and in the dark, for so it was thought best, since
he knew the first part of the way well and would need
daylight more after coming to the unknown country.
And because he had thrown the chance of next value,
Wiki was given the place of lesser honor, because of
lesser danger, that of messenger to the Clans of the Rainbow
and the Bear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">On the Walpi Trail</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If Kwasa had not felt so proud of the honor that had
been shown him, he might have feared to go down the
long, dark canyons alone. But, boylike, his thoughts
were not so much on the danger of his task as they were
upon the rewards he might hope for when it was done,
for he knew the people of the Cliffs would pay royal honors
where they were due. And he never thought of failure,
for surely one so high in favor with the gods could
not fail, however great the task.</p>

<p>So Kwasa picked his way with a light heart along the
first well-known part of the journey. He wanted to be
far from home by daybreak, and ready to undertake the<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
unknown paths where he would need all his sharpness
of sight to keep the right direction. He had received
many and definite instructions from the old men, who
knew the Walpi road well, and he felt confident of his
ability to reach the Seven Cities without loss of time.</p>

<p>The sun came up, hot and strong, just as he emerged
from the shadows of the last wooded canyon and stepped
forth upon the wide-spaced plateau that stretched away
toward Walpi. There was no chance for cover now, he
realized, a little startled at the thought, for he had not
before considered this difference between a trail on the
plateau and one through the canyons. If he had not been
afraid both of delay and of losing the trail if he should
attempt to follow it by night he would have liked to lie
down in a hidden nook and wait for dusk again rather
than to run the risk of a race across such open and dangerous
country by day. But he knew no time should be
lost, so, eating his breakfast from his food-bag as he
went along, he swung forward with the long, easy strides
of one who is accustomed to travel much by foot.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the forenoon when a fitful gust of
wind brought a strange, regular, pounding sound to his
ears. He could not think what it was. Again it came,
louder than before, a sharp, ringing “clickety-clicket,”
that brought him to a standstill. Then, too late for flight
or any chance of concealment, he recognized the sound as
one that he had never heard more than once or twice in
his life—the beating of hard-ridden ponies’ hoofs.</p>

<p>In another minute he saw them coming, a cloud of dark,
terrible riders in fantastic head-dress, with their almost<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
naked bodies horribly striped and scarred. At a glance
he knew them, though his only idea of them had been
formed from the tales he had heard the men tell, and in
the same moment gave himself up for lost. For they
were the hated enemies whose awful deeds made the
blood run cold at the barest thought of them—the Utes
of the northeastern mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="Ref_042" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i042.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#BRef_042">Kwasa knew they had seen him</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="BRef_042" href="#Ref_042">Kwasa knew they had seen him</a>, so, giving up the hope
of hiding which had flitted momentarily through his
mind, he determined to stand his ground and sell his life
as dearly as he could. He ran a few steps from the trail
and placed his back against a jutting ledge of rock, at the
same time drawing his bow and setting one of his sharpest
arrows. Hardly had he time to make even this scanty
preparation when they were upon him, a yelling, death-dealing
whirlwind of fiendish faces and quick-footed,
fiery-eyed ponies.</p>

<p>With an agonized thought of home, of the trust in which
he now must fail, and of the terrible danger which was
sweeping down upon the Cliff people, he drew his arrow
back to the head. Excited as he was, he took steady
aim, and a painted warrior slid limply from his pony’s
neck and rolled over in the dust. As he hastily fitted
another arrow he felt a stinging pain in his throat, his
hand lost its strength, the sky reeled about him and
turned dark—and then he knew no more.</p>

<p>When he came to himself again he lay where he had
fallen on his face in the red dust of the plateau. How
sick and dizzy he felt! His first thought was to wonder
how he came there; the next to remember that the Utes<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
were headed straight for the canyons, on what awful errand
he did not dare to think. He knew the Cliff village
could be held for some time, but would not these
fiendish foes at last be able to overcome the peaceful, unwarlike
men of the Cliffs, no matter what their advantages
might be? Help must be brought, and brought
quickly. A glance at the sun assured him that he had
not long lain unconscious, even though he knew he must
have been left for dead. With a great effort he pulled
himself to his feet. How black the sunlight grew! And
what was that queer, choking thing that seemed to be
gripping him by the throat? Putting up his hand, he
felt the shaft of an arrow which had pierced his neck,
running through until the point projected above his
shoulders. With a shudder he tried to pull it out, but
the pain turned him sick again. Then, too, even through
the turmoil of his thoughts he realized that to remove
the arrow would mean a great and weakening loss of
blood. So, blinded and choking as he was, the brave lad
stumbled along as fast as he could, imploring the gods
to give him strength to reach Walpi and send aid to his
people before he should die.</p>

<p>It seemed ages before he saw the dark outlines of the
pueblo of Walpi rising above the rounded crest of the
mesa. But it was not so far from where he fell after all,
for he had been nearer than he believed when the attack
occurred. He could never quite remember how things
happened after that. He had a vague memory of Sado’s
voice calling out in sharp surprise, of telling his story
quickly between the gasps of his failing breath, and of<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
a sudden great bustle in the court of the pueblo. Only
one thing he remembered distinctly, the sudden idea that
flashed through his mind at sight of Sado.</p>

<p>“The hidden path,” he gasped, “tell them to take the
hidden path. It will bring them up from the back. No
one knows it except—except—” and here in spite of
himself his voice trailed off into silence and the blindness
that was worse than midnight came over his eyes
again.</p>

<p>As in a dream he heard Sado’s excited reply:</p>

<p>“I know—I know—I will lead them. Have no fear,
for we will save your people yet!”</p>

<p>And then gentle hands laid him down, and he thought
no more except that it was very good to rest.</p>

<p>The terrible Battle of the Cliffs had been fought and
done for many weeks before Kwasa was strong enough to
hear about it. For the arrow in his throat had come
very near indeed to causing his death, and only the tender
nursing of careful and practised hands could have
brought him back to life and strength again. There was
one pair of slim, soft hands that he always knew, even
through his delirium, so gentle and capable were they,
and so soothingly did they place upon his poor, torn
throat the cooling poultices of pounded herbs. After he
grew able to think again he fell to wondering what the
face would be like that belonged with such dear, gentle
fingers; but so weary and listless was he that even after
the thought came it was a long time before he opened
his eyes to see. But when he did look up into the beautiful
young face that bent so anxiously above him, he<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
knew that one of two things would surely happen—either
he would stay at Walpi forever, or he would not go back
to the canyons alone.</p>

<p>And that day Kwasa heard the story of the Battle of
the Cliffs. It was Sado who told it, helping the words
with vivid gestures of his long, brown fingers. He told
how bravely the men of the village had held their own
for many long and fearful hours, even against the death-bearing
poisoned arrows of their foes; and how, hard
pressed as they were and overwhelmed by numbers, as
the Utes swarmed up the niche stairway, the men who
stood along the ledge sold their lives at a heavy price.
And then, just as the Utes were sounding their wild
whoop of final victory, and were pressing upward unchecked
over the narrow stair, so slippery with the horrible
slime of blood, the fresh band of fighters which
Sado had led secretly up the hidden path sounded their
battle cry from the back of the long court into which they
had come unseen. At this the savages had wavered a
moment in surprise, and then, seeing the lithe brown
bodies of the men of Walpi, whose prowess they knew of
old, had broken and fled, many of them losing their foothold
and falling down the face of the cliff to a horrible
death on the rocks below. And just then had come up
from the south the bands from the Rainbow and Bear
Clans, summoned by Wiki, and before the sun had set
upon the narrow valley the grass was stained with a
deeper red than that of the red dust. Only two Ute
horsemen were able to break through the terrible ring of
death that shut them in and get away on their fleet ponies.<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
And that, said Sado, was just as it should be, for
with the story of that disastrous fight as a warning it
would be long before the northern tribes would attempt
to take revenge.</p>

<p>The day came at last when Kwasa was strong enough
to go back to his people. Glad as he was at the thought
of seeing them all again, a greater gladness lay at his
heart—a joy even greater than all the honor that his
grateful people were waiting to give could bring. For
Ani, the gentle sister of Sado, who had nursed the
stricken messenger so faithfully and well, was easily persuaded
that her services might still be needed by her
brave young patient. So she decided to go back across
the mesas and down the cool, dusky canyon paths with
him, lest evil should again befall him.</p>

<p>So it happened that when the rejoicing people of the
Cliffs came down the niche stairway to welcome their
honored hero, they took also to their grateful hearts the
dark-eyed girl who had saved him from death for them.
And not the less did they love her because she was the
sister of Sado, who had brought them help in their hour
of greatest need.</p>

<p>“But what of Wiki?” said Kwasa, when they would
have overwhelmed him with loving honors.</p>

<p>“He has had his share,” answered Wiki himself, pressing
the hand of his old playfellow affectionately. “Besides,
my little deed needed no honor, since it did not
require a particularly stout heart to run an errand where
there was no danger. Yet Mosu has promised me no
less a gift than that I should lead the dance of the priests<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
in his own place at the next Blessing of Seeds. And he
says he will make a priest of me when the time comes.
Besides—” he paused in some confusion, and beckoned
to a pretty brown maiden who stood not far away.</p>

<p>“Besides?” prompted Kwasa with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not all the maidens in the world dwell on the mesa
of the Seven Cities,” blurted out Wiki, taking the girl’s
slender fingers in his own.</p>

<p>Kwasa laughed, then his face grew grave.</p>

<p>“Yet it was well for me that one maid dwelt there,”
he said softly, looking up into Ani’s sweet face with
adoring eyes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
